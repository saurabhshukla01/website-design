                                <p>"Our research of a suitable HR Solution ( for a growing start-up company) found OrangeHRM having good reviews and was a good fit for our criteria. The opportunity to trial the product at no cost for some time was critical in our selection process, as this allowed us to be confident the functionality was suitable and it operated as expected.<br />
<br />
We previously managed our HR administration manually using MS Excel and Word but now the system allows us to streamline employee management and simplifies the processes for employees to manage their time and attendance, leave and personal HR records.<br />
<br />
What we like about OrangeHRM is the helpful support during implementation and general good ongoing support which is very critical to us. The system is also relatively user friendly, easy to use and configurable."</p>

Thanks to you, the process is now agile and smooth, allowing us to shift time and energy on other tasks. The implementation of the system was efficient and easy, considering the fact that OrangeHRM did not have their team physically present in Denmark. The team had everything under control at all times and left no doubts about their professionalism. During the implementation, training and joint problem solving afterwards, OrangeHRM proved to be flexible, easy to communicate with and always demonstrated a &quot;Can do!&quot; attitude. I highly recommend their services."</p>

No one had difficulty entering, storing and retrieving data. To my surprise, it took little time to enter their personal data indicating that in real time, this is not a time consuming activity. Needles to say, this was a different type of learning experience for my students, but more importantly, it demonstrated to them the value of an information system in general and the capability of the Orange HRM product specifically."</p>

The prospect of using a functional HRIS for a capstone HR class at the undergraduate level seems to make perfect sense, but how would they react? To say that OrangeHRM has been anything less than helpful would be an understatement. They have assisted me in getting ready for the 2011 fall semester, and our students are poised to reap the benefits of their generosity.<br />
<br />
With modules that include leave management, recruitment, performance management, and benefits tracking (to name just a few of the available modules in the OrangeHRM Live product), our students will learn concepts and practical applications in a real-world product that they just wouldn&#039;t have access to anywhere else.<br />
<br />
I am very much looking forward to the full use of this product in the coming months, and will report out (via email, blog, or tweet) the regular progress of this endeavor. Many thanks to the folks at OrangeHRM for their assistance in getting ready a mock database of 400+ employee records. Let the course begin!"</p>

                                <p>"At the University at Albany we have an MBA concentration in Human Resource Information Systems. Crucial to the program is the ability for our students to gain hands on experience with a fully functional HRIS. The challenge has been gaining access to such a system in a cost effective manner. We recently decided to use OrangeHRM in our program and we have not been disappointed. From a visit by their CEO who discussed the history and goals of Orange HRM to their willingness to provide online training to students, OrangeHRM has given us access to not only the software, but also to the ideas and motivations behind its design. Students find the interface intuitive and easy to use. This means that I can spend more time teaching the students about the broader data design and capture issues facing HR as they design and implement an HRIS and less time teaching the students to use the software."</p>

                                <p>"Until 2009, the Human Resource Office of the University of Belize had relied solely on human memory and hands to deal with their day to day activities and the office. When OrangeHRM was introduced to us it was such a relief. So many manual things were eased and the speed of delivering tasks was amazing. Reports are generated in minutes, leave updates can be given via email in seconds and even our contracts and job letters can be accurately prepared using the system. The system has moved our HR Office from being a manually based office to a Technologically Advanced Office.<br />
<br />
What is more amazing is that all this has been done electronically. At one single instance there was a face to face training but besides that all other trainings were done online: over the phone or over chatting, emailing, etc. Training classes has helped me so much that I think I would be lost if it wasn&#039;t for the trainings. I am very grateful for the patience and the time your team has had to walk me through all the aspects of OrangeHRM and training me to be an expert in the system. At the University I am the only one who has been fully trained and who knows almost every single aspect of our system. With the training I have received from your team I can train others here and we have planned to have a more in dept training where all HR staff members will be able to use the system fully.<br />
<br />
I would like to encourage you to continue online trainings as it helps tremendously. Keep up the high quality of work and the patience to deal with so many questions and queries from us."</p>

In our organisation, when an employee wants to request for leave, they would have to fill out a leave form which needs to be signed by the head of the employees department or their immediate Supervisor and the Human Resource Manager. In the event that one of these people are not in the office, the whole process is delayed. The advantage therefore with the OrangeHRM is that the employee&#039;s supervisor or head of department or the Human Resource Manager does not have to be in the office to approve this request. So in short, it will eliminate time wastage and unnecessary paper work."</p>
