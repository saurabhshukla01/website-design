   <strong>I feel proud</strong>, to see the world finally noticing <strong>India’s Swachh Bharat Mission</strong> and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi being conferred the Goalkeepers Global Goals Award for his government's Swachh Bharat programme by Bill and Melinda Gates foundation of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.<br />
</div>
<br />
<div><br />
   As a <strong>homemaker turned Social Activist</strong>, who strongly believes about cleanliness and hygiene, <strong>I am doing my bit for the Swachh Bharat goal.</strong> I am maintaining high standards of hygiene and sanitation in my home, and helping keep my constituency in Bengaluru clean.<br />

   As a <strong>homemaker turned Social Activist</strong>, who strongly believes about cleanliness and hygiene, <strong>I am doing my bit for the Swachh Bharat goal.</strong> I am maintaining high standards of hygiene and sanitation in my home, and helping keep my constituency in Bengaluru clean.<br />
</div>
<br />
<div><br />
   But it’s not enough to have public toilets and clean homes if our public spaces are not Swachh. For a country of a billion people who operate so much on our faith, it’s time we use our faith to move mountains: the mountains of waste we create in our religious places. <br />
</div>
<div> <em><strong>Record-breaking heat waves</strong> have become a regular occurrence in India, killing thousands of people. Melting snow-caps are slowly increasing the sea level.</em> </div>
<br />
<div><em><strong>Rainfall patterns in India are changing</strong>, and this has had a devastating effect on farmers’ harvests and affecting </em><em>the migration patterns of different birds and animals.</em></div>
<br />
<div> <em><strong>The hottest days of the year will grip much of central and northern India</strong> in the coming days, and this heat wave is unlikely to end anytime soon.</em> </div>
<br />
<div> <em><strong>Dust-storms and increased levels of air pollution</strong> - these seem to have become the normal way of living for most of us.</em> </div>
<br />
<div> I am a class 11 school student, and being a nature enthusiast, I know what <strong>repercussions</strong><strong> several years of ignorance towards global warming</strong> will have for India in the long run. </div>
<br />
<div> The human race has already caused irreversible climate change, the impacts of which are being felt around the world. <strong>But it’s not too late.</strong> </div>
<div> <em><strong>She was beaten by her husband for no fault of hers just because of some casual disagreement with him</strong></em>. This is a tragic incident. Imagine the plight which my cousin sister would have gone through when she was being hit at that time. </div>
<br />
<div> And this is not an isolated incident. <em><strong>Thousands of women in India go through this ordeal regularly so much so that domestic violence has now become the norm</strong></em>. Its prevalence has now become a gory truth with travails on the soul of a woman as she has nowhere to get justice from; because domestic violence is often justified -- either by her husband, her family or by the victim i.e the women herself. </div>
<br />
<div> When my cousin sister narrated this story to me: <em><strong>I was shocked. And frightened.</strong></em> Because her husband was not an uneducated, illiterate man. <em><strong>This atrocity was committed by him despite being educated</strong></em>. I realized then that education is not a sufficient condition to challenge deeply rooted & ingrained social & cultural norms. </div>
<br />
<div> Hence I wondered -- <em><strong>what if my future husband turned out to be a monster like him?</strong> </em>What if I, as a woman, was stuck in a situation similar to my sister's where my circumstances turned out to be such that I could have no way out. </div>
<br />
<div> And so, I wanted to do something. I didn't want myself or million other women to suffer the oppression of their husbands which leaves the women with abhorrent scars of abuse -- both physical & psychological. Despite policies in place against domestic violence, the problem is still rampant in India as mores of male dominance are valued more .</div>

<div> <strong>I cannot never forget what I saw inside a bucket in a toilet on National Highway 75 in Karnataka.</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> Algae and larvae, or simply put, <strong>the eggs of worms and mosquitoes breeding on the water surface.</strong> I had gone to urinate when my <strong>long-distance public bus</strong> from Sakleshpur to Bengaluru had <strong>halted</strong> for passengers to relieve themselves. I had expected to see water in the bucket as any normal person would. So you can imagine my <strong>disgust</strong>. I raced out, unable to use the toilet. And suppressed the urge to urinate for the remainder of the journey. </div>
<br />
<div> It gets worse. The facility was unmarked. It was <strong>frightening to search for it</strong> <strong>in the dark</strong>. A strange man, who I later found out was visually impaired, was sitting outside the facility, charging people Rs 5 to use the toilet. <strong>There were no sign-boards or demarcations of toilets for men, women and others</strong>. There were <strong>no lights</strong> inside or outside. I had to use the light on my cellphone to find my way. </div>
<br />
<div> Inside was <strong>a different kind of hell</strong>.<strong> Doors with broken locks, missing taps, broken commodes, no mug, soap or a dustbin</strong>;<strong> a pile of soiled sanitary napkins rotting away in a corner</strong>. </div>
<br />
<div> When I called out for water, the man said there was none<strong>.</strong> That explained the <strong>terrible stench</strong>. This sorry excuse for a <strong>toilet had not been cleaned in days!</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> If this is making you sick, <strong>imagine the plight of thousands of women who are forced to use such facilities every single day when they travel the 350-kilometre stretch from my town Sakleshpur.</strong> </div>
<div> The Forts in Maharashtra depict the valour of great leaders like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and our glorious history. However the Government of Maharashtra has decided to convert these forts Heritage Hotels and Wedding Venue. </div>
<br />
<div> Strongly oppose Maharashtra Governments decision of converting Forts into Heritage hotels and wedding venues. The forts in our state need to be preserved and made history museums of global standards. </div>
<br />
<div> I urge every one of you to sign this petition asking the Government of Maharashtra to withdraw this decision. </div>
<br />
<div> It was around 8:45 pm when the bell rang. I was in my room. I could vaguely hear my dad as he rushed out of the house. Confused, I called him. After a few seconds, he picked up and I realized that he was sobbing. I’d never seen my dad cry. And then, he said something that will haunt me forever – <strong>“Raghav is gone.”</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> My little brother was only 18. </div>
<br />
<div> He was my best friend and my idol. He was the kind of person who wanted to help everyone but never asked for anything in return.  </div>
<br />
<div> <strong>On 6th January, 2019 – we lost him to suicide.</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> My story is not unique, this is the story of a million families who lose a brother, a sister, a father, a mother or a friend to this silent prey. According to WHO, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young adults. Data released recently by the online journal Lancet Public Health, as part of its Global Burden of Disease Study (1990 to 2016), revealed, for the first time, the quantum of the problem India is facing: <strong>In 2016, it had the highest number of suicide deaths </strong>and it's only increasing every year. ></div><br />
<div> Another disturbing truth that I came across while doing my research was that most of the suicide helpline numbers do not work. I dialed around 15 numbers but most of the calls went unanswered, some numbers were switched off. <strong>Only three responded.</strong> </div>
<br />
<br />
<div> A year ago the Supreme Court of India decriminalized homosexuality in its historic 6th September 2018 verdict by striking down Sec 377 of the Indian Penal Code. But the recent suicide of Avi Patel has made us introspect to realize how far we actually are from a lgbtq+ friendly society.</div>
<br />
<div> <strong>8% of Indians identify as LGBTQIA+ - that’s approximately 10.4 crore people.</strong> Most of these <strong>individuals are subjected to bigotry, bullying, discrimination and hatred in one form or the other every day</strong>. Be it in schools and colleges, work spaces, public places like restaurants and bars, or even in their own homes. </div>
<br />
<div> The Supreme Court in its verdict directed the Government to take all the measures and correctly broadcast that homosexuality is no longer a crime, to create public awareness by eliminating the stigma against the LGBTQIA+ community. </div>
<br />
<div> The support of parliamentarians like Mrs.Supriya Sule, Dr.Shashi Tharoor and Ms. Priya Dutt have boosted the morale of the LGBTQIA+ community. But <strong>a legislature brought in by the government that protects the rights of the members of this community would truly be a progressive step in embarking social inclusion.</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> Whether an individual identifies as a Male, female, transgender/transsexual or Intersex; any one can be subjected to assaults, sexual violence and at times rape, which often leads to acid attacks. Thus there is an <strong>utmost need to make provisions in the IPC to make these laws Gender Neutral and inclusive of all people.</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> <strong>The longer we delay such a law that tackles homophobia and transphobia, the greater the toll it will take on the mental health of the LGBTQIA+ members.</strong> They struggle with immense trauma, distress, depression and are prone to suicidal tendencies. Thus we request the government to provide a free suicide helpline operating 24x7x365 for all individuals inclusive of alternative sexual orientations and gender identities. </div>
<div> Abhilasha Arup Das Adhikari - a mother of a seven month old - wanted to go shopping one evening to a mall in Kolkata. Soon her baby was hungry and she started looking for a room to breastfeed her baby. As a new mother, she did not have the confidence to breastfeed at any of the stores and started looking for a breastfeeding room. </div>
<br />
<div> When she approached the staff at the mall, she was shocked to find out that there was no breastfeeding room in the mall. She panicked and started worrying about where she could feed her baby. She asked the mall authorities where she could feed her hungry and crying child and she redirected to a – toilet! </div>
<br />
<div> <strong>As a new and vulnerable mother who was not confident about breastfeeding in public, she felt helpless.</strong> <strong>Abhilasha even attempted to breastfeed in a toilet; but was unable to because the strong smell in the toilet.</strong> </div>
<br />
<div> When she came home, she posted a review on the Facebook Page of the Mall’s page stating that she was not happy with the services of the mall because she was unable to breastfeed her baby .</div>
<br />
<div> <strong>The mall responded by saying that breastfeeding is a ‘home chore' that should be done at home.</strong>  </div>
<br />
<div> <strong>As a woman, and as a mother of two, I was very angry and upset when I read Abhilasha’s story. I myself had dealt with a similar situation. I had also been asked to breastfeed my two month old in a toilet. </strong> </div>
<br />
<div> Women need to be enabled by the government policies if they wish to breastfeed. Beastfeeding is not just good for the baby, but it is great for the mother too. By enabling breastfeeding, health care costs of a nation can be brought down because it reduces the odds of several health conditions arising.  </div>
<br />
<div> <strong>Countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland have laws which state that it is a breastfeeding woman's right to breastfeed wherever and however she feels comfortable. She should not be discriminated against because she is breastfeeding. </strong> </div>
